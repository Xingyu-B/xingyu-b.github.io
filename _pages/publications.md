__Extreme Temperatures and Internal Migration: Evidence from China.__ 2022.
<details>
<summary>Absract</summary>
  
  This paper investigates the impacts of extreme temperatures on internal migration in China from 1995 to 2010, employing county-level data for analysis. The findings reveal a significant migrate-out effect from counties experiencing extreme low temperatures; specifically, an additional day with temperatures below 10F increases net outmigration by 0.073 percentage points compared to a day with temperatures ranging between 50-60F. Conversely, increased temperature act as a deterrent to migration, with male outmigration showing a significant decrease under extreme high temperatures (>90F). This divergence in response to extreme temperatures is postulated to stem from variations in perceptual abilities. Intriguingly, female migrants display a distinct pattern, remaining unaffected in their migratory responses to both extreme high and low temperatures. This deviation may be attributed to entrenched traditional Chinese ideologies influencing female mobility. Further investigation into rural regions and agricultural growing seasons yields results consistent with the baseline results, with a more pronounced effect from high temperatures, thereby providing a suggestive evidence of potential liquidity constraints based on the agricultural mechanism, suggesting that the financial hardships from failed agricultural outputs can act as a barrier, preventing individuals from migrating even if they are motivated to do so.
