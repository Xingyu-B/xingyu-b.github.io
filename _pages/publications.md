    >   Females are traditionally viewed as the primary providers of informal parental care in China, especially in rural areas. We investigate whether the health insurance coverage in rural China, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), can unleash more female labor forces by reducing the burden of informal parental care. Employing a heterogeneity-robust difference-in-differences estimation, we find that the NCMS has a significant positive impact on female labor supply, primarily in non-farm occupations. In contrast, we observe no significant changes in male labor supply. We explore the mechanism by showing that the NCMS significantly decreases the provision and demand for parental care by females. Our findings illuminate the importance of public health insurance in developing countries, highlighting its potential to stimulate labor supply, mitigate gender disparities in the labor market, and empower women more bargaining power within household.

    >    This paper evaluates the reform and opening-up policy in China, a transition from the central planned to market economy, on the increase of the child's educational attainment. Based on the individual-level population census data and a cohort difference-in-differences strategy, I find that the reform policy has a subtle but significantly positive effect on the increase of the childâ€™s educational attainment, especially in less educated areas. The results are robust to the inclusion of confounders and provide suggestive evidence that the market economy can ameliorate the maternal malnutrition and reduce the regional and gender education inequality caused by the inappropriate economic system.

- __Extreme Temperatures and Internal Migration: Evidence from China.__ 2022.

    >     This paper investigates the impacts of extreme temperatures on internal migration in China from 1995 to 2010, employing county-level data for analysis. The findings reveal a significant migrate-out effect from counties experiencing extreme low temperatures; specifically, an additional day with temperatures below 10F increases net outmigration by 0.073 percentage points compared to a day with temperatures ranging between 50-60F. Conversely, increased temperature act as a deterrent to migration, with male outmigration showing a significant decrease under extreme high temperatures (>90F). This divergence in response to extreme temperatures is postulated to stem from variations in perceptual abilities. Intriguingly, female migrants display a distinct pattern, remaining unaffected in their migratory responses to both extreme high and low temperatures. This deviation may be attributed to entrenched traditional Chinese ideologies influencing female mobility. Further investigation into rural regions and agricultural growing seasons yields results consistent with the baseline results, with a more pronounced effect from high temperatures, thereby providing a suggestive evidence of potential liquidity constraints based on the agricultural mechanism, suggesting that the financial hardships from failed agricultural outputs can act as a barrier, preventing individuals from migrating even if they are motivated to do so.
